        <p>Welcome to the University API Project! I have provided graphics and visualizations that provides comprehensive information about 
          universities from around the world. The home page has a bar chart that represents the number of universities in each country, and can be
          filtered to list only the top N countries. The university table page has a table of each university for the associated country that was chosen.
          By selecting a country, it will display the name of the university, as well as the web page associated with that university.
          With this API, users can easily search and access data on universities for research, academic purposes, or personal interest. 
          Our project aims to make it easier for users to find and access university data. Thank you for visiting our site and we hope you find it helpful!</p>
